To join a game use the following cURL command with the generated id of a game and a 
body with a name, here *Name*:<br>
`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"name":"Name"}'  http://localhost:8080/games/{id}/join`

game and a body with the players name and move:<br>

## Possible improvements
- Make the application more maintainable by adding tests to the RockPaperScissorsController.
- Give an id to players so that name does not have to be unique.
